Title: About me
Date: 2014-12-13 18:32


I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Zomato](www.zomato.com). 
My major areas of interests are Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I completed undergrad from [IIIT-Allahabad](www.iiita.ac.in) with major in Electronics and Communication. 
I started this blog to share my knowledge. I find writing also helps me in getting deep insights of the topic. I am also in the learning phase. Any suggestions/comment will definitely be helpful.  

<br>

Some of my projects in the Deep Learning includes Synthesizing Insights and actionable items from user opinions and reviews, 
Photo Classification tailored to Food search and Discovery platforms 
and EyeQ (Image Quality and Aesthetics determination). Major of the posts will be concentrated around these topic only. 
At 40, I will start writing about life and experiences, not now.

I dream to pursue Artificial Intelligence as an independent researcher in future.
