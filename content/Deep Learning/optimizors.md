The fundamental of any Machine learning models is defining a cost function or loss function. Optimizing over data-set i.e. minimizing our
cost function or loss enables us to learn the model. The technique of efficiently minimizing our cost function is done using the
well defined algorithms under the premise of Optimizers.
