Category: Data Analytics with Python

Before starting the course for Data Analytics with Python, following is the Pre-requisite:
- Basic Understanding in Python

Goal for the course will be understanding the how basic Python can be used for analytical purposes. For this later in the
course we will be exploring the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

It has demographic data about the passengers that were on the ship and whether or not they survived the trip. 
It will allow us to do data analysis, data visualisation, data preparation, and try a simple prediction model.
