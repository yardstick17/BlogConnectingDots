This Paper is second in the series by Mikolov et al. of [Statistical Language Models Based on Neural Networks](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2009/mikolov_ic2009_nnlm_4.pdf)
It is an extension to the proposed Skip-gram model in terms of quality and training speed. It also incorporates methods for Phrase representation and explores the 
interesting property of Skip-gram model.
